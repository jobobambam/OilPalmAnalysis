# OilPalmAnalysis
Examples of basic geoalgorithms used to analyse palm oil plantation metrics.

This repository holds:

Andamy Properties Plantation Sabah, Malaysia

- Shapefile containing boundary features of the plantation (Plantations.shp).
- Open source imagery of the plantation (os imagery pulled from bing and google maps is linked within POPAnalysis QGIS project file).

Unknown Oil Palm Plantation, Saraburi, Thailand

- Shapefile containing boundary features of the plantation (TahiPlantation.shp).
- Selection of drone captured multispectral bands: NIR & Red (hyperlink to google drive containing files below)
- NDVA layer (in google drive)
- Treecount- point shapefile identifying each tree in the plantation found using my treecount algorithm (ThaiTreeCountCentroids.shp).
- Copy of the scripts used to create the NDVI and Treecount geoalgorithms (NDVI.py and Treecoun_Point_Script.py).
