# OilPalmAnalysis
Examples of basic geoalgorithms used to analyse palm oil plantation metrics.

This repository holds:

Andamy Properties Plantation Sabah, Malaysia

- Shapefile containing boundary features of the plantation.
- Open source imagery of the plantation.

Unknown Oil Palm Plantation, Saraburi, Thailand

- Shapefile containing boundary features of the plantation.
- Selection of drone captured multispectral bands: NIR & Red (only those used in analysis were uploaded due to size)
- NDVA layer
- Treecount- point shapefile identifying each tree in the plantation found using my treecount algorithm.
- Copy of the scripts used to create the NDVI and Treecount geoalgorithms.
